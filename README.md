# irSocial

irSocial is a data-crunching tool for IRC moderation teams. It's written in python, and it's designed to help moderation teams catch bad actors and sockpuppets and identify pain points like crisis topics, and poor moderator coverage. 

Because this is a passion project, ideally it will also do things like track social network formation across irc users and display those graphically. 

TODO: 
1) network formation 
2) semantic analysis of logs 
3) richer user class 
4) message class for richer message data storage 
5) gui
